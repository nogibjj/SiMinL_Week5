# SiMinL_MiniProj1

This serves as a Python template that we can use as a starting point for future Python projects. It contains:

A Makefile, which runs required installations, and then formats, lints, and tests the code.

A requirements.txt file, which lists out some basic DevOps and Data Science packages along with specific versions for installation.

A devcontainer folder.

Github Actions workflows directory and yml file for CI/CD integration.

A basic python script for adding two numbers as well as a testing file, to demonstrate the functionality of the template.
